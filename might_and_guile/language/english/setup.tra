Psionic powers are physically demanding, costing the rogue a temporary reduction in max hit points (3, 5, 7, or 9); for most powers these hit points are restored at a rate of 1/round. Some powers may be maintained indefinitely at a cost of an ongoing reduction in max hit points. In those cases the hit points re not restored until after the power has been canceled (at the same rate of 1/round). Maintainable powers are interrupted if the rogue is reduced to 25% hit points. Most rogues can only learn psionic powers from a single discipline.

CLASS RESTRICTIONS:
- Alignment restricted to any except lawful good.
- Hit Die: d6

@20501  = ~psypher~
@20502  = ~Psypher~
@20503  = ~PSYPHER: the Psypher is someone who (mostly) turns away from larcenous pursuits, and focuses on education and meditation to fully harness the power of the mind and the body. Psyphers are generally very well-educated and very healthy, treating their body as a temple. Through study and discipline, they can learn to use psychic abilities from any psionic discipline.

Abilities:
- Begins with access to the Adrenaline Rush and Kinetic Ram abilities. May learn another psionic ability every at every third level of experience, up to 18th level. The abilities that a Soulblade may learn include:

@20580  = ~Ultrablast~
@20581  = ~Ultrablast: this is a massive, omnidirectional psionic blast which savagely attacks the minds of the psion's enemies. All such enemies within 20 feet must save vs. Wands with a -3 penalty or be stunned for three rounds. 

Using this ability increases the psion's fatigue and causes a 25-point temporary reduction in <PRO_HISHER> max hit points.~
@20582  = ~Tower of Iron Will~
@20583  = ~Tower of Iron Will: this ability is similar to Intellect Fortress, protecting against any mind-affecting magic or psionics. However, in this case the psions can extend that protection to all allies within 20 feet. 

This is a maintainable power; it increases the psion's fatigue, and while in use, it causes a 25-point temporary reduction in <PRO_HISHER> max hit points. These hit points slowly return after the ability is canceled.~
@20584  = ~Cancel Tower of Iron Will~
@20585  = ~Earthquake~
@20586  = ~Earthquake: this ability causes a strong tremor to affect the ground nearby. All creatures in the vicinity take damage over the course of three rounds, and must make a saving throw or fall down in the first round.

Using this ability increases the psion's fatigue and causes a 25-point temporary reduction in <PRO_HISHER> max hit points.~
@20587  = ~Stasis Field~
@20588  = ~Stasis Field: this ability freezes all beings in the vicinity, at a molecular level. For twelve seconds the psion alone may move and interact with the frozen world. The stasis field prevents the psion from physically damaging anything during this time, but <PRO_HESHE> may initiate psionic abilities or magical powers, the effects of which will take place once the stasis ends. Beware: beings with godlike characteristics or powers may be immune to the effects of a stasis field.

Using this ability increases the psion's fatigue and causes a 25-point temporary reduction in <PRO_HISHER> max hit points.~
@20589  = ~Solar Flash~
@20590  = ~Solar Flash: this ability creates an intense ray of pure light energy to beam out at everyone within a 20-ft. radius of the psion. All enemies within the area of effect take 3d6 points of damage and must save vs. Spell or be blinded for 1 turn. Undead that are hit by the sunray take 20d6 damage.

Using this ability increases the psion's fatigue and causes a 25-point temporary reduction in <PRO_HISHER> max hit points.~
@20591  = ~Storm of Energy~
@20592  = ~Storm of Energy: this ability fills the vicinity with a churning storm of fire and electricity. For three rounds, enemies in the storm take 1d8 fire damage and 1d8 electrical damage (save for half).

Using this ability increases the psion's fatigue and causes a 25-point temporary reduction in <PRO_HISHER> max hit points.~
@20593  = ~Monstrous Evolution~
@20594  = ~Monstrous Evolution: this ability causes the psion's body to rapidly grow into a hideously powerful, hulking form. The monstrous form has an AC of -5, a THAC0 of 2 and attacks twice per round with powerful fists. These attacks do 3d6 crushing damage plus 2d4 poison damage. In this form the psion is immune to entanglement, web and hold effects, and to all poisons.

Upon resuming <PRO_HISHER> natural form, the psion becomes fatigued and suffers a 25-point temporary reduction in <PRO_HISHER> max hit points.~
@20595  = ~monster creature~
@20596  = ~Attack~
@20597  = ~Shapeshift natural form~
@20598  = ~Fission~
@20599  = ~Fission: this ability creates a fully functioning, fully cognizant clone of the psion. The clone has effectively 60% of the psion's experience and vitality, and operates according to the psion's will (since they are in fact the same person). Maintaining the clone's corporeal integrity involves a supreme act of will; the clone disintegrates after 1 turn.

Using this ability increases the psion's fatigue and causes a 25-point temporary reduction in <PRO_HISHER> max hit points.~
@20600  = ~Choosing this ability will enable you to choose another psionic ability. In addition, if you have learned at least four abilities in any of the four psionic disciplines, you will be able to learn one of two HLA-level powers from that discipline. The eight HLA-level psionic abilities are:

- Telepathy: Ultrablast. Causes all nearby enemies to make a saving throw or be stunned.
- Telepathy: Tower of Iron Will. This acts like the Intellect Fortress power, but protects all nearby allies while it is maintained.
- Telekinesis: Earthquake. This acts like the priest spell of the same name.
- Telekinesis: Stasis Field. This act's like the wizard spell Time Stop, but the psion cannot physically attack while the stasis field is active.
- Pyrokinesis: Solar Flash. This acts like the priest spell Sunray, but will not automatically kill undead creatures.
- Pyrokinesis: Energy Storm. This acts like the priest spell Storm of Vengeance, but with no accid or poison damage.
- Biokinesis: Monstrous Evolution. This ability transforms the psion into a hulking beast, similar in appearance to a Shambling Mound.
- Biokinesis: Fission. This acts like the wizard spell Simulacrum.

Unlike lesser psionic powers, these abilities may be used once per day. In each case, using the ability increases the psion's fatigue and causes a temporary reduction of 25 max hit points. Note: you may only learn one of the two ultimate powers in each discipline.~
@20601  = ~Telepathy~

@20615  = ~Psychic Crush~
@20616  = ~Psychic Crush: this ability initiates a powerful mental attack, stunning a target creature for 3 rounds unless the target saves vs. wands with a -2 penalty. At 6th level the penalty to the saving throw increases to -3, and at 12th level it increases to -4. The cost is 9 hit points.~
@20617  = ~Cancel Psychic Crush~

@20623  = ~Immobilize~
@20624  = ~Immobilize: the target of this power is held frozen for 2 rounds upon a failed saving throw vs. wands, and then Slowed for 1 round while struggling to regain control of <PRO_HISHER> body. Even if the save is made, the target is briefly Slowed while fighting off the telekinetic control. At levels 6 and 12, the target's saving throw is rolled with a -1 and -2 penalty, respectively. The cost is 4 hit points.~
@20625  = ~Cancel Immobilization~
@20626  = ~Kinetic Ram~
@20627  = ~Kinetic Ram: this ability blasts a target with powerful but unfocused telekinetic energy, causing 2d3 crushing damage and, upon a failed save vs. wands, knocking the target back 10 feet. At 6th level the damage is 2d4 and the save is rolled with a -1 penalty; at 12th level the damage is 2d6 and the save is rolled with a -2 penalty. The cost is 5 hit points.~
@20628  = ~Cancel Kinetic Ram~
@20629  = ~Inertial Barrier~
@20630  = ~Inertial Barrier: this ability creates a movable barrier inches from the psion's skin, which has several protective effects: it provides a +2 bonus to AC and 40% damage resistance against crushing and missile attacks; a +1 AC bonus and 20% damage resistance against slashing attacks; 25% resistance to fire, acid, and magic damage; and immunity to the Magic Missile spell. This is a maintainable power. The cost is 7 hit points.~
@20631  = ~Cancel Inertial Barrier~
@20632  = ~Psychic Knife~
@20633  = ~Psychic Knife: the psion can focus telekinetic energy into a razor-sharp blade emanating from <PRO_HISHER> hand. This force can be wielded like a sword, as if the rogue had Mastery (+++) in its use, doing 2d3 slashing damage and 2d3 magic damage. This is a maintianable power. The cost is 7 hit points.~
@20634  = ~Cancel Psychic Knife~
@20635  = ~Instinctive Freedom~
@20636  = ~Instinctive Freedom: this ability is unlike most othes. The psion's mastery of the telekinetic discipline enables <PRO_HIMHER> to break free of any bonds; and to initiate the power at an instinctive level, whenever <PRO_HESHE> is helpless. The cost of the ability at the time it is triggered is 9 hit points.~
@20637  = ~Cancel Free Action~
@20641  = ~Pyrokinesis~
@20642  = ~Pyrokinesis: this feat confers the 'Static Transfer' ability, and allows for learning more psionic abilities within the Telepathy discipline.~
@20643  = ~Static Discharge~
@20644  = ~Static Discharge: this ability is similar to the Shocking Grasp wizard spell. The psion collects static electricity in his hand, and then uses it to attack an enemy. The enemy takes 2d4+1 points of damage, and must save vs. wands or be stunned for 1 round. At 6th level the damage is 3d4+2 and the save is rolled with a -1 penalty; at 12th level the damage is 4d4+3 and the save penalty increases to -2. The cost is 4 hit points.~
@20645  = ~Cancel Static Discharge~
@20646  = ~Energy Transfer~
@20647  = ~Energy Transfer: the immediate expenditure of energy to initiate this ability is converted into a steady bloom of positive energy in the target, resulting in a slow healing. At 1st level the target recovers 5 hit points over the cours of 10 rounds. At 6th level the target recovers 10 hit points over the same period, and at 12th level the target recovers 15 hit points over that time. The cost is 5 hit points.~
@20648  = ~Cancel Energy Transfer~
@20649  = ~Psychic Combustion~
@20650  = ~Psychic Combustion: this ability allows the psion to spontaneously create a brief but powerful fire in any location. The flames to 3d4+3 fire damage to all enemies within 5 feet of the flames. At 6th level the damage increases to 4d4+4, and at 12th level the damage increases to 5d4+5. The cost is 7 hit points.~
@20651  = ~Cancel Psychic Combustion~
@20652  = ~Energy Dispersion~
@20653  = ~Energy Dispersion: while this ability is maintained, the psion instinctively absorbs and deflects harmful energies. <PRO_HISHER> resistance to energy-based damage (fire, cold, electricity, and magic damage) is set to 75%. The cost to maintain the barrier is 9 hit points.~
@20654  = ~Cancel Energy Dispersion~
@20655  = ~Generate Lightning~
@20656  = ~Generate Lightning: after taking a few moments to collect static energy from the surrounding area, the rogue can discharge it as violent lightning energy. The lightning strikes a chosen target and arcs to any other enemies within 10 feet (the psion has some measure of control over the energy and can protect <PRO_HISHER> companions). The discharge does 2d6 lightning damage, which is halved upon a successful save vs. wands. At 6th level the damage is 3d6 and the save is rolled with a -1 penalty. At 12th level the damage is 4d6 and the save is rolled with a -2 penalty. The cost is 9 hit points.~
@20657  = ~Cancel Generate Lightning~
@20661  = ~Biokinesis~
@20662  = ~Biokinesis: this feat confers the 'Adrenaline Rush' ability, and allows for learning more psionic abilities within the Biokinesis discipline.~
@20663  = ~Adrenaline Rush~
@20664  = ~Adrenaline Rush: this ability temporarily boosts the psion's strength by 1 point and constitution by 2 points, for 4 rounds. Afterward, the psion becomes fatigued (-4 to STR) for 2 rounds. At 6th level the bonuses are increased to +2/+3, and at 12th level they are increased to +3/+4. The cost is 4 hit points, and the ability may not be used again until the fatigue has worn off.~
@20665  = ~Cancel Adrenaline Rush~
@20666  = ~Metabolic Boost~
@20667  = ~Metabolic Boost: this ability supercharges the psion's biological processes for 3 rounds, doubling movement speed and adding an extra attack per round, like the Haste wizard spell. At 6th level the effect lasts for 4 rounds, and at 12th level it lasts for 5 rounds. Afterward, the psion becomes fatigued (-4 to STR) for 2 rounds. The cost is 5 hit points.~
@20668  = ~Cancel Metabolic Boost~
@20669  = ~Bioregeneration~
@20670  = ~Bioregeneration: this ability triggers powerful healing responses in the psion's immune system, resulting in the regeneration of 1 hit point per round. This is a maintainable power; the psion can all such healing to fully take its course; however, the psion must concentrate on the power, and may not engage in physical combat while the power is maintained. At 6th level the psion regenerates 3 hit points every 2 rounds, and at 12th level the psion regenerates 3 hit points per round. The cost to maintain the regeneration is 7 hit points.~

This is a maintainable power. The cost is 9 hit points.~
@20674  = ~Cancel Camouflage~
@20675  = ~Carapace~
@20676  = ~Carapace: this ability causes the rogue's skin to harden into a fast-growing, and strong but brittle shell. This provides a -2 bonus to AC, and harmlessly absorbs 1 physical attack each round. This is a maintainable power. The cost is 9 hit points.~

@21821  = ~GALLANT: This is a Demibard kit. Part charming aesthete, part dashing warrior, gallants travel the land in search of beauty, love, and adventure.

Their code, similar to a paladin's, requires that they defend the innocent and members of the opposite sex, and aid the needy in times of trouble and danger.

~
@21851  = ~jinxer~
@21852  = ~Jinxer~
@21853  = ~JINXER: This roguish demibard mixes casual disregard of the notion of property rights with the innate talent to manipulate luck and probabilities - and a flair for showmanship. Sometimes Jinxers operate within a Gypsy clan such as the Vistani (in which case they may be called 'Zingaros'), and sometimes they operate as lone wolves. Often singers in their spare time, Jinxers have a love of song and may use some basic bardic abilities, such as being able to manifest an aura that hexes nearby rivals. To the great vexation of many a noble, Jinxers often turn this talent to selfish ends. With a knack for turning the tables, they can be very frustrating opponents.

Abilities:
- May use a Hex Aura, which causes a 1-point penalty to Luck and saving throws to all enemies within 20 feet.

A herald might act as Maitre'd for a ball, using <PRO_HISHER> enhanced to lore to announce guests... and then might break into a guest's room to investigate possible threats... and then might command troops in battle. Some heralds remain close to their liege, but others take to the road, extending their influence into foreign territory.

~
@21891  = ~ACROBAT: As entertainers, most Acrobats are typically found accompanying carnivals or circuses, although a troupe of Acrobats can put on a remarkable show all by themselves. The often perform in large taverns or in clubs, using their arts to draw in the crowd and captivate them long enough for the proprietor to drain their purses. Acrobats are flashy and love to show off their skills; whatever they do, they like to do with a sense of style and a flair for the dramatic. Acrobats sometimes become cat burglars extraordinaire, and they are also useful adventuring allies, as they can squeeze into places where others cannot go without the aid of magic. Their skill at avoiding traps and other dangers also makes them excellent scouts.

Advantages:
-  +1 bonus to Armor Class
-  +1 bonus to Armor Class vs. missiles every 8 levels

~
@21892  = ~CHORISTER: Music, whether hymn, symphony or dark chanting intonation, plays an important part in the services of most deities. For aiding in performing rituals or just leading the faithful in worship, most holy places have at least one bard, known as a Chorister.

Choristers are not only to be found within temple walls, however; many faiths use them as missionaries, helping to bring new worshippers into the fold. Many an adventuring bard with a religious bent can also end up as a Chorister, finding their prayers answered by the deity they venerate.

Advantages:
-  May use an Aura of Blessing, constantly providing all allies within 20 feet with the benefits of the Bless spell.
-  From 6th level, may use a Positive Energy Aura, providing all allies within 20 feet with the benefits of the Negative Plane Protection priest spell. (The Chorister cannot cast spells while the Positive Energy Aura is in effect.)

~
@21893  = ~DIRGESINGER: Dirgesingers voice melodies not of celebration and joy, but of sorrow and grief. They seek to spread this melancholy outlook far and wide, believing that only those who give in to their sadness can truly understand the world.

These sad wanderers seek to express their grief through songs that teach the hearts of their listeners the meaning of true sorrow. Some of these fallen bards want nothing more than for others to understand the depths of their loss. A few are sinister creatures who believe that, since joy has been extinguished for them, they must in turn extinguish the joy of others by using their powers to teach the folly of love, the futility of hope, and the finality of the grave. Dirgesingers of this last sort often associate themselves with powerful undead; serving in the courts of vampire lords or lich-kings.

Dirgesingers are limited to non-good alignments.

Advantages:
-  May use an Aura of Weakness, which cause a 1-point penalty to all attack and damage rolls of enemies within 20 feet.

-  From level 5 may use a Song of Horror ability 1/day. This has the same effects as the level 2 Wizard spell, Horror
-  From level 7 may use a Song of Grief ability 1/day. This has the same effects as the level 4 Wizard spell, Confusion
-  From level 9 may use a Song of Awakening ability 1/day. This has the same effects as the level 5 Wizard spell, Animate Dead

Disadvantages:
-  Only has one-half normal Lore value
~
@21894  = ~GYPSY: Gypsies are often called "travelling people" or "forest nomads," typically wandering the lands in caravans comprising of brightly painted carts or wagons.  These people are well-known for their strange music and dances, typically surviving in their wandering lifestyle by entertaining villagers and folk in the places they roam.  Gypsies wander the land, experiencing life as they go.  They travel until they find something of interest, where they establish a temporary camp and remain until the urge to see more of the world overpowers their desire to stay.  Adventuring gypsies may be on a personal quest to locate some unique place or thing or may simply be out to experience the great wonders that appear along the adventuring path.

Gypsies are often misunderstood by others, who classify them as thieves, beggars, carnival people, nomads, or any number of other erroneous names.  They are also very open and welcoming to those who seek to learn their ways and join them in their wandering, garnering for them a reputation for stealing children in the night and then spiriting them off into the wilderness.  It should be noted that not all Gypsies are bards or have bardic abilities; Gypsy bards, known among Gypsy clans as "rawuns," function as the chief storytellers, lore-keepers, fortune tellers, and spiritual advisers of their Gypsy clans.

Advantages:
-  Has a +1 bonus to saves vs. spells per 8 levels
-  Can cast Curse once per day. The opposite of a Bless spell, this gives foes a -1 penalty to THAC0 and saves
-  May use a Hex Aura, which causes a 1-point penalty to Luck and saving throws to all enemies within 20 feet.
-  From 6th level, may use a Mind Blank Aura, which causes the Gypsy's mind to be undetectable by, and unaffected by, psionics or mind-altering magic. (The Gypsy may not cast spells while the Blank Aura is in effect.)
- May learn to manifest other bardic aura effects.

Disadvantages:
-  Cannot learn mage spells from the schools of Conjuration, Invocation or Transmutation

@21900  = ~This ostentatious peacock-blue hat is festooned with green and purple feathers. Once the possession of an unfailingly chipper bard, the hat was stolen when the bard couldn't resist showing off the hat in a seedy tavern and bragging about its magical powers. In truth the hat has only moderate, if functional, enchantments on it. But its stylish appearance makes it a coveted choice for many bards.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
- Immunity to silence and deafness
- Emanates a basic Bardic Aura, providing a +1 bonus to allies' Luck, saving throws, and thieving skills
- The bard wearing this hat may use another Bardic Aura simultaneously

Weight: 0~
@21901  = ~Declamation~
@21902  = ~Declamation

Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell can cast spells with a verbal component without having to make any noise. Effectively, this spell cancels the effects of Silence and makes the recipient immune to it for the spell's duration.~
@21903  = ~Word of Revocation~
@21904  = ~Word of Revocation 

Level: 3
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell can remove magical effects from one subject. This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning and Spell Deflection. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of the Dispel Magic is above the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 5% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 5% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.~
@21905  = ~Shout~
@21906  = ~Shout

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 35-ft. cone with 15-deg. arc
Saving Throw: Special

This spell grants the caster tremendous vocal powers, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to emit an earsplitting roar from <PRO_HISHER> mouth in a cone-shaped area of effect. Any creature within this area is deafened for 9 rounds and suffers 4d6 points of magic damage. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half.~

@2502   = ~BERSERKER: This is a warrior who, during combat, can achieve an ecstatic state of mind that will enable him to fight longer, harder, and more savagely than any person has a right to. Berserkers tend to be barbarian-like in nature, but not always. Sometimes it is a conscious choice that a warrior in training makes. Regardless, opponents on the battlefield will be unsettled when they see the savage and inhuman elements of the Berserker's personality. This class is common amongst dwarves, known to them as the Battlerager.

Abilities:
- May use the Berserking ability once per day every 4 levels. 

BERSERKING: For 30 seconds, the character gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls and an extra 1/2 attack per round, and is immune to charm, fear, hold, stun, and sleep effects. The character also gains 15 temporary Hit Points, which are taken away at the end of the berserk spree (possibly knocking the character unconscious).

After the effects end, the character becomes winded, suffering a -2 penalty to Armor Class, to-hit rolls, and damage rolls.

Restrictions:
- May only achieve Mastery (+++) with melee weapons.
- May only become proficient (+) with ranged weapons and fighting styles.
