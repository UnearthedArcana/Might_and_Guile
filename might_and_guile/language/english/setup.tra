@12003  = ~RANGER: The general term 'Ranger' includes several varieties of hardy warriors which share certain characteristics: they are strong fighters, and they are also skilled in stealth and scouting. In battle, rangers often use light, single-handed weapons, and are adept and wielding a weapon in each hand simultaneously.

Rangers are generally good-natured and protective of their fellow men, using their skills to support and provide for communities in wild frontiers. They operate according to a code of honor and may lose some abilities if they fail to uphold a Ranger's ethical standards.

Others have skill sets derivative of Rangers, but without as close a connection to nature and without such a strict code of ethics. Archers, Stalkers, and similar characters employ similar tactics to rangers, but are not bound to any particular alignment.

@16505  = ~MARKSMAN: Whether you need to hit a target with a poisoned arrow or shoot a rope to the windowsill of a noble's mansion for a burglary, the Marksman is a highly trained and stealthy sharpshooter who can get the job done.

Abilities:
- +1 bonus to hit and damage rolls with missile weapons for every three levels of experience.
- Can achieve High Mastery with bows and crossbows.
- May learn to use five Called Shots, at levels 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Called Shots may be used at will, and the effects work for one round. The Marksman has a +2 bonus to thac0 and damage while performing Called Shots, but remains stationary during that time. The Marksman may chose from among the following Called Shots:

- Trip Shot. Aimed at the legs, this shot causes the target to fall down for one round upon a failed save vs. Breath.
- Pinning Shot. This shot catches the target's clothes or body and pins them to the wall, floor, or other object, rendering the target unable to move for two rounds upon a failed save vs. Breath.
- Disarming Shot. This shot knocks loose the targets grasp on a weapon, resulting in a -4 penalty to thac0 and reduced APR for one round, upon a failed save vs. Breath.
- Blinding Shot. Aimed at the eyes, this shot causes the target to flinch and momentarily lose their vision, being Blinded for one round upon a failed save vs. Breath.
- Rapid Shot. This technique allows the archer to fire much faster - with one extra attack  per round - albeit less accurately - with a 2-point penalty to attack and damage rolls.

Restrictions:
- May only distribute 20 skill points per level among thieving skills.
- Reduced backstab multiplier.

@2052   = ~ARCHER: The Archer is the epitome of skill with the bow, able to make almost any shot, no matter how difficult. To become so skilled with the bow, the Archer has had to sacrifice some proficiency with melee weapons and armor.

Advantages:
- +1 to hit and damage rolls with ranged weapon at levels 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20.
- Can achieve Grand Mastery with bows and crossbows.
- May learn to use a Called Shot at levels 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Called Shots may be used at will, and the effects work for one round. The Archer has a +2 bonus to thac0 and damage while performing Called Shots, but must remain stationary during that time. The Archer may chose from among the following Called Shots:

- Trip Shot. Aimed at the legs, this shot causes the target to fall down for one round upon a failed save vs. Breath.
- Disarming Shot. This shot knocks loose the targets grasp on a weapon, resulting in a -4 penalty to thac0 and reduced APR for one round, upon a failed save vs. Breath.
- Pinning Shot. This shot catches the target's clothes or body and pins them to the wall, floor, or other object, rendering the target unable to move for two rounds upon a failed save vs. Breath.
- Blinding Shot. Aimed at the eyes, this shot causes the target to flinch and momentarily lose their vision, being Blinded for one round upon a failed save vs. Breath.
- Hammer Shot. This shot strikes with incredible force, adding 1d6 crushing damage to the normal missile damage and knocking the target back 5-10 feet, unless the target makes a successful save vs. Breath.
- Rapid Shot. This technique allows the archer to fire much faster - with one extra attack  per round - albeit less accurately - with a 2-point penalty to attack and damage rolls.

Disadvantages:
- May only wear leather, studded leather, and hide armors (and elven chain).
- May only become Proficient with melee weapons.
- May not use the Charm Animal ability.~

@2402  = ~RANGER: The general term 'Ranger' includes several varieties of hardy warriors which share certain characteristics: they are strong fighters, and they are also skilled in stealth and scouting. In battle, rangers often use light, single-handed weapons, and are adept and wielding a weapon in each hand simultaneously.

The 'true' ranger is a master of <PRO_HISHER> local geography, learning skills to survive in the harsh wilderness where few others could. Rangers are generally good-natured and protective of their fellow men, using their skills to support and provide for communities in wild frontiers. They operate according to a code of honor and may lose some abilities if they fail to uphold a Ranger's ethical standards.

Others have skill sets derivative of Rangers, but without as close a connection to nature and without such a strict code of ethics. Archers, Stalkers, and similar characters employ similar tactics to rangers, but are not bound to any particular alignment.

CLASS FEATURES:

- May wear helmets.
- May wear any armor and use any weapon.
- May not exceed Specialization (two slots) in any weapon class.
- May achieve Specialization (two slots) in any fighting style.
- Begins Specialized (two slots) in Two-Weapon Style and may place a third slot into it. 
- May use the Hide In Shadows ability while wearing no armor, leather armor, or studded leather armor.
- Alertness: rangers have excellent visual acuity and can spot enemies before being seen by those enemies.
- May use the tracking ability at will, which can often give a general sense of what kind of creatures are in the area, and in which direction.
- May perform a backstab when attacking while hidden, with a x2 damage modifier, starting at level 6.
– May cast nature-related priest spells.

@2502  = ~BERSERKER: This is a warrior who, during combat, can achieve an ecstatic state of mind that will enable him to fight longer, harder, and more savagely than any person has a right to. Berserkers tend to be barbarian-like in nature, but not always. Sometimes it is a conscious choice that a warrior in training makes. Regardless, opponents on the battlefield will be unsettled when they see the savage and inhuman elements of the Berserker's personality. This class is common amongst dwarves, known to them as the Battlerager.

Abilities:
- May use the Berserking ability once per day every 4 levels. 

BERSERKING: For five  rounds, the Berserker gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls and an extra 1/2 attack per round, and is immune to charm, fear, hold, stun, feeblemind, and sleep effects. The Berserker's current hit point total is unknown during this time, and <PRO_HESHE> cannot be killed, attacking relentlessly until the berserk effect ends. But if <PRO_HESHE> has one hit point or less when the berserk state ends, <PRO_HESHE> will die at that time. Finally, while in this state, a Berserker has a -10 penalty to hit with ranged weapon attacks.

After the effects end, the character becomes winded, suffering a -2 penalty to Armor Class, to-hit rolls, and damage rolls.

Restrictions:
- May only achieve Mastery with melee weapons.
- May only become proficient with ranged weapons and fighting styles.

@2651   = ~MONK: these meditative warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor.

@40801  = ~bard~
@40802  = ~Bard~
@40803  = ~BARD: the Bard is a musically-oriented offshoot of the Enchanter specialist class. While wizards master magical effects by forcing their minds through formulae with special syntax, bards understand magic as beautiful patterns and algorithms. Their approach is more casual; bards cannot use the most powerful magical spells, and they almost always pair the study of magic with one or more other disciplines, usually thievery but sometimes martial training. At the same time, bards' use of magic can be more improvisational than that of most wizards. Rather than discrete spells, bards store repertoires of magical techniques, which they can call up and play like a musical refrain. Additionally, bards can channel limited magical effects through special 'Bard Songs' rather than spells, weaving an illusion or enchantment in the harmonized vibrations of the air.  

BARD SONG: bard song effects fall into three categories. Harmonious "Inspirations" provide bonuses to allies near the bard; dissonant "Emanations" create effects that penalize nearby enemies; and personal "Auras" create focused effects, beneficial or dangerous, that cling to the bard's body like armor. Bards' aptitude for music allows them to learn several bard songs over time, and they can discover more via special musical scrolls around the world.

Abilities:
- Lore increased by 5 points per level.
- May use the Bardic Inspiration ability. While active, this provides allies with a +1 bonus to Luck and saving throws.
- May learn to perform other Bard Songs.

- May not learn spells from the Evocation or Necromancy schools of magic.
- May not learn 9th-level spells.
- May not use the Hide in Shadows or Move Silently thieving abilities.
- No backstab damage multiplier.

More rogue than fighter, the blade's fighting style is flashy and entertaining; nevertheless, <PRO_HISHER> training makes <PRO_HIMHER> more adept with a sword than most rogues. As a species of bard, Blades may perform Bard Songs, specializing in ones that make them appear more dangerous or harder to hit.

@40837  = ~Jinxer~
@40838  = ~JINXER: This roguish bard mixes casual disregard of the notion of property rights with the innate talent to manipulate luck and probabilities - and a flair for showmanship. Sometimes Jinxers operate within a Gypsy clan such as the Vistani (in which case they may be called 'Zingaros'), and sometimes they operate as lone wolves. Often singers in their spare time, Jinxers have a love of song and may use some basic bardic abilities, such as being able to manifest an aura that hexes nearby rivals.

~
@40893  = ~DIRGESINGER: Dirgesingers voice melodies not of celebration and joy, but of sorrow and grief. They seek to spread this melancholy outlook far and wide, believing that only those who give in to their sadness can truly understand the world.

These sad wanderers seek to express their grief through songs that teach the hearts of their listeners the meaning of true sorrow. Some of these fallen bards want nothing more than for others to understand the depths of their loss. A few are sinister creatures who believe that, since joy has been extinguished for them, they must in turn extinguish the joy of others by using their powers to teach the folly of love, the futility of hope, and the finality of the grave.

@40894  = ~GYPSY: Gypsies are often called "travelling people" or "forest nomads," typically wandering the lands in caravans comprising of brightly painted carts or wagons.  These people are well-known for their strange music and dances, typically surviving in their wandering lifestyle by entertaining villagers and folk in the places they roam.  Gypsies wander the land, experiencing life as they go.  They travel until they find something of interest, where they establish a temporary camp and remain until the urge to see more of the world overpowers their desire to stay.  Adventuring gypsies may be on a personal quest to locate some unique place or thing or may simply be out to experience the great wonders that appear along the adventuring path.

Gypsies are often misunderstood by others, who classify them as thieves, beggars, carnival people, nomads, or any number of other erroneous names.  They are also very open and welcoming to those who seek to learn their ways and join them in their wandering, garnering for them a reputation for stealing children in the night and then spiriting them off into the wilderness.  It should be noted that not all Gypsies are bards or have bardic abilities; Gypsy bards, known among Gypsy clans as "rawuns," function as the chief storytellers, lore-keepers, fortune tellers, and spiritual advisers of their Gypsy clans.

Advantages:
-  Has a +1 bonus to saves vs. spells per 8 levels
-  Can cast Curse once per day. The opposite of a Bless spell, this gives foes a -1 penalty to THAC0 and saves
-  May use a Hex Emanation, which causes a 1-point penalty to Luck and saving throws to all enemies within 20 feet.
-  From 6th level, may use a Mind Blank Aura, which causes the Gypsy's mind to be undetectable by, and unaffected by, psionics or mind-altering magic. (The Gypsy may not cast spells while the Blank Aura is in effect.)
- May learn to manifest other bardic aura effects.

Disadvantages:
-  Cannot learn mage spells from the schools of Conjuration, Invocation or Transmutation

@40900  = ~This ostentatious peacock-blue hat is festooned with green and purple feathers. Once the possession of an unfailingly chipper bard, the hat was stolen when the bard couldn't resist showing off the hat in a seedy tavern and bragging about its magical powers. In truth the hat has only moderate, if functional, enchantments on it. But its stylish appearance makes it a coveted choice for many bards.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
- Immunity to silence and deafness
- Radiates a basic Bardic Inspiration, providing a +1 bonus to allies' Luck, saving throws, and thieving skills
- The bard wearing this hat may use a different Bard Song effect simultaneously

But unlike sages, Loremasters feel compelled to go out and discover knowledge by exploring the unknown. They can often be found fleeing huge boulders in trapped dungeons, battling savage practitioners of strange magics, and discovering secret passages in ancient castles. Loremasters are fond of any aspect of history that makes a good story - and they enjoy living those stories as much as telling them.
