@21801  = ~bard~
@21802  = ~Bard~
@21803  = ~BARD: the Bard is a musically-oriented offshoot of the Enchanter specialist class. While wizards master magical effects by forcing their minds through formulae with special syntax, bards understand magic as beautiful patterns and algorithms. Their approach is more casual; bards cannot use the most powerful magical spells, and they almost always pair the study of magic with one or more other disciplines, usually thievery but sometimes martial training. At the same time, bards' use of magic can be more improvisational than that of most wizards. Rather than discrete spells, bards store repertoires of magical techniques, which they can call up and play like a musical refrain. Additionally, bards can channel limited magical effects through special 'Bard Songs' rather than spells, weaving an illusion or enchantment in the harmonized vibrations of the air.  

BARD SONG: bard song effects fall into three categories. Harmonious "Inspirations" provide bonuses to allies near the bard; dissonant "Emanations" create effects that penalize nearby enemies; and personal "Auras" create focused effects, beneficial or dangerous, that cling to the bard's body like armor. Bards' aptitude for music allows them to learn several bard songs over time, and they can discover more via special musical scrolls around the world.

Abilities:
- Lore increased by 5 points per level.
- May use the Bardic Inspiration ability. While active, this provides allies with a +1 bonus to Luck and saving throws.
- May learn to perform other Bard Songs.

- Automatically gains knowledge of the following spells: Command, Vocalize (as a 1st-level spell), Silence 15' Radius, Shout, Secret Word, Greater Command, Power Word: Silence, Great Shout, and Earthquake.

Restrictions:
- May cast spells one level later than a wizard.
- May not learn spells from the Evocation, Conjuration, or Necromancy schools of magic.
- May not learn 8th- or 9th-level spells.
- May not use the Hide in Shadows or Move Silently thieving abilities.
- No backstab damage multiplier.

@21837  = ~Jinxer~
@21838  = ~JINXER: This roguish bard mixes casual disregard of the notion of property rights with the innate talent to manipulate luck and probabilities - and a flair for showmanship. Sometimes Jinxers operate within a Gypsy clan such as the Vistani (in which case they may be called 'Zingaros'), and sometimes they operate as lone wolves. Often singers in their spare time, Jinxers have a love of song and may use some basic bardic abilities, such as being able to manifest an aura that hexes nearby rivals. To the great vexation of many a noble, Jinxers often turn this talent to selfish ends. With a knack for turning the tables, they can be very frustrating opponents.

They often pose as entertainers or some other seemingly-innocuous profession, in order to infiltrate societies and organizations.  They have a voluminous knowledge of culture, history and art, in order to play their role well, in addition to magical powers, the skills of a thief, and in emergencies, the ability to brawl their way out of trouble.

@21858  = ~BLADESINGER: Combining martial skill with magical prowess, Bladesingers have the resources to face nearly any threat. They master the use of bladed weapons wielded in one hand, keeping the other free for spellcasting. Name notwithstanding, Bladesingers can actually use many different weapons; most elven armies and societies have different units devoted to particular weapons. Bladesingers can choose their weapon of focus at 9th level.  (These are exclusively melee weapons; the Bladesong is specific to hand-to-hand combat. If a Bladesinger needs to attack from range, <PRO_HESHE> uses magic to do so.

Acrobats are flashy and love to show off their skills; whatever they do, they like to do with a sense of style and a flair for the dramatic. Acrobats sometimes become cat burglars extraordinaire, and they are also useful adventuring allies, as they can squeeze into places where others cannot go without the aid of magic.

@21892  = ~CHORISTER: Music, whether hymn, symphony or dark chanting intonation, plays an important part in the services of most deities. For aiding in performing rituals or just leading the faithful in worship, most holy places have at least one bard, known as a Chorister.

Choristers are not only to be found within temple walls, however; many faiths use them as missionaries, helping to bring new worshippers into the fold. Many an adventuring bard with a religious bent can also end up as a Chorister, finding their prayers answered by the deity they venerate.

~
@21893  = ~DIRGESINGER: Dirgesingers voice melodies not of celebration and joy, but of sorrow and grief. They seek to spread this melancholy outlook far and wide, believing that only those who give in to their sadness can truly understand the world.

These sad wanderers seek to express their grief through songs that teach the hearts of their listeners the meaning of true sorrow. Some of these fallen bards want nothing more than for others to understand the depths of their loss. A few are sinister creatures who believe that, since joy has been extinguished for them, they must in turn extinguish the joy of others by using their powers to teach the folly of love, the futility of hope, and the finality of the grave. Dirgesingers of this last sort often associate themselves with powerful undead; serving in the courts of vampire lords or lich-kings.

Dirgesingers are limited to non-good alignments.

Advantages:
-  May use an Emanation of Weakness, which cause a 1-point penalty to all attack and damage rolls of enemies within 20 feet.

-  Only has one-half normal Lore value
~
@21894  = ~GYPSY: Gypsies are often called "travelling people" or "forest nomads," typically wandering the lands in caravans comprising of brightly painted carts or wagons.  These people are well-known for their strange music and dances, typically surviving in their wandering lifestyle by entertaining villagers and folk in the places they roam.  Gypsies wander the land, experiencing life as they go.  They travel until they find something of interest, where they establish a temporary camp and remain until the urge to see more of the world overpowers their desire to stay.  Adventuring gypsies may be on a personal quest to locate some unique place or thing or may simply be out to experience the great wonders that appear along the adventuring path.

Gypsies are often misunderstood by others, who classify them as thieves, beggars, carnival people, nomads, or any number of other erroneous names.  They are also very open and welcoming to those who seek to learn their ways and join them in their wandering, garnering for them a reputation for stealing children in the night and then spiriting them off into the wilderness.  It should be noted that not all Gypsies are bards or have bardic abilities; Gypsy bards, known among Gypsy clans as "rawuns," function as the chief storytellers, lore-keepers, fortune tellers, and spiritual advisers of their Gypsy clans.

Advantages:
-  Has a +1 bonus to saves vs. spells per 8 levels
-  Can cast Curse once per day. The opposite of a Bless spell, this gives foes a -1 penalty to THAC0 and saves

Disadvantages:
-  Cannot learn mage spells from the schools of Conjuration, Invocation or Transmutation

Once the possession of an unfailingly chipper bard, the hat was stolen when the bard couldn't resist showing off the hat in a seedy tavern and bragging about its magical powers.

They can often be found fleeing huge boulders in trapped dungeons, battling savage practitioners of strange magics, and discovering secret passages in ancient castles. Loremasters are fond of any aspect of history that makes a good story - and they enjoy living those stories as much as telling them.

Abilities:
- Through their devoted study of the past, gain a fundamental understanding of many strange magical artifacts. Thus, they can use any magical item.
- Loremasters' studies enhance their understanding of magic, so much that they cast spells as if they were one level higher.

Restrictions:
- Loremasters may only spend 18 skill points toward thieving skills each level, and cannot practice the arts of Picking Pockets or Setting traps.
- Loremasters do not do extra damage by backstabbing.

Using this Tome will allow the reader to engage in a career as a Loremaster.

@5410  = ~spellbender~
@5411  = ~Spellbender~
@5412  = ~SPELLBENDER: The goddess Mystra rules all magic, and mandates that spellcasters must formulate known spells, and must memorize the patterns of those spells in order to successfully release them. But as with any system, the are gaps and shortcuts that may be used to circumvent the rules. Sorcerers are born with the ability to shape magic directly, though only into a limited number of effects; and wild mages shape spells without discipline, achieving powerful results at the risk of disastrous side-effects. Spellbenders make a science of mapping the ways to bypass Mystra's restrictions. Practicing as generalist clerics as well as studying arcane magery, they learn to manipulate the intersection of those two areas of magic. 

Abilities:
- Spellbenders may sacrifice a memorized wizard spell to instead create one of numerous divine effects; and they may sacrifice a memorized cleric spell to create an arcane effect. 

Restrictions:
- None

@5413  = ~Spellbender's Studies~
@5414  = ~The goddess Mystra rules the fabled Weave of Faerun, the ethereal conduit that allows mortals to shape magical energies into spells and effects. In order to avoid disasters like that which befell Anauroch, Mystra ensures that the use of those energies is strictly controlled: spellcasters must formulate the Weave into specific, known spells, and must memorize the patterns of those spells in order to successfully release them.

But, as with any rigid system, the are gaps and shortcuts that may be used to circumvent Mystra's rules. Sorcerers are born with the ability to focus the Weave directly, though only into a limited number of effects. Wild mages shape spells without discipline, achieving powerful results at the risk of disastrous side-effects.

Unlike those classes, Spellbenders make a science of mapping the ways to bypass Mystra's restrictions. Practicing as generalist clerics and studying arcane magery, they learn to manipulate the intersection of those two areas of magic. They may sacrifice a memorized wizard spell to instead create one of numerous divine effects; and they may sacrifice a memorized cleric spell to create an arcane effect. Some energy is lost in the translation - the improvisational effects must be spells of lower level than the one sacrificed. (It is unknown what happens to the lost energy - some believe this practice has contributed to the recent rise of wild magic and sorcerers. Spellbenders must be wary, as they are apt to be persecuted by Mystra's Monitors.)

While Spellbenders are not as powerful one-to-one as a Sorcerer or Wild Mage or Monitor, the studious application of their knowledge gives them precise control over the Weave that is unmatched by any other spellcaster.

The secrets contained in this tome may enable the owner to learn the skills and abilities of a Spellbender.
